title: Schema change notifications

You can [configure Apollo Studio](./notification-setup) to notify your team whenever any changes (additions, deprecations, removals, etc.) are made to your graph's registered schema:

<img class="screenshot" src="./img/integrations/schema-notification.jpg" alt="Schema notification Slack message." width="400"></img>

You can configure separate change notifications for each [variant](./org/graphs/#managing-variants) of your graph.

## Setup

See [Setting up Studio Notifications](./notification-setup).
